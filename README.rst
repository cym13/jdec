Description
===========

Jdec is a simple java decompiler wrapper designed to use multiple engines and
automatically support multiple file formats with no frill.

Why ?
=====

Because I often get to reverse engineer applications that are given to me in
many different formats. Got a whole directory of zip files full of APKs?
Throw it to Jdec!
